Unity强化学习

In this project,I first trained an ai drone with Ml-Agents' algorithm to navigate to destination and hover on certain checkpoints awaiting the fire fighting task to be completed.

In PythonScripts folder,a few python files are placed which I used to test my own RL algorithms like DQN,Policy Gradient and PPO.To set up the simple encironment I set an area over the drone where the drone can be rewarded once it get into and start a new episode.
